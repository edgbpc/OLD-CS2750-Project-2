Trial time script


No command line options.
Added echo line to ask the user if they wanted to input tmes
Added echo line to prompt user the format that trial times should be entered.
Loop used to enter times also verifies that a float was entered and terminates if not.
Added echo line to report back average trial time.  
Formula for computing average allows up to hundreth decimal place.  IE average of 11.5+11.5+11.5+11.5+11.6 = 11.52 and does not make cut.  
I do not loop my program to continually add runners. 

           ##Not required additions##
Added code to save the results to a file trial.txt.  Appends a new runner to end of the file for a running list of all runners, their times, and results if they made the team.
Added code to verify floats entered
